# My semestral project for java
It is a simple 2d game made with sdl2. To run it you need either java8 or java21.

When running on linux or mac you will need to compile it yourself. Use maven for that using `mvn package` (or you can use `make` if you have make installed) and then run it using `java -jar target/engine-1.0.0.jar` or `make run`. Though it is precompiled on windows it might work on linux or mac... i don't really know how java works.

When running on windows just run game.exe (is prepackaged for windows and should run well).
